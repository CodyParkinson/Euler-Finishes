Q: The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
14 = 2 x 7
15 = 3 x 5
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
644 = 2Â² x 7 x 23
645 = 3 x 5 x 43
646 = 2 x 17 x 19.
Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

A: 134043
