# Euler-Finishes
These are the Project Euler Questions I have been able to complete

Respecting the Project Euler guidelines, I will not be posting anything I solve above question 100. I see a lot of places with just the answers posted, so if you are looking to just boost your profile - go look for those pages. 

My goal is to provide my (very unoptimized) code for others to look through. I have found Project Euler to be such an amazing place to learn new techniques and ideas. The first 100 questions are a great learning ground to help boost into the later problems. There is really no sense of getting too stuck on the first 100 (save the desk throwing for the later problems).

So, if you are looking for the clout of just having the answers to the first 100, well I guess thatâ€™s up to you. Honestly if you get your confidence out of showing others you have solved math problems on a niche website - I hope these help with that.
